# ubs-project

Assumption made during implementation:
 - phrases with hyphen are considered to be two separates words.
 
 ## How to run program
 
 Sample usage:
 java -jar ubs-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "../src/test/resources/INPUT.txt" 


Improvement to consider in future:
 - adding exception handlers in IO classes
 - adding more tests
 - customizing path for OUTPUT.txt file
